change Config.java in TrackChat(android app) enter the new server IP
Make sure to get new server key,app key from google API console and then add it to server and app
If there is any issue in setting up test enviornment email-dgupta13@illinois.edu
Deploy server using Eclipse and have the server API installed.
Note: If you run the source code map maynot load. Please refer https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start for getting new Debug Key.

Directly run the .apk file on device.
NOTE- I may not be running my server 24x7 so email me before testing so that I can start it.
